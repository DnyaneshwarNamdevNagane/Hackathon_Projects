# TVS Hiring Hackathon
My Solution to Hackathon

A Financial institution in India wants to leverage Machine Learning techniques to determine the client’s loan repayment abilities and take proactive steps to reduce the magnitude of exposure to default.
Goal: The goal of the problem is to predict whether a client will default on the vehicle loan payment or not, given the recent data of all the loan transactions. This can help the institution to distinguish the future applicants who might default. For each ID in the Test Dataset, you must predict the “Default” level
Note: Please answer the below descriptive question in the Jupyter Notebook Itself. This is going to carry more weightage in the final evaluation. This is an open-ended question and you are free to come up with a detailed explanation basis the analysis, model building exercise you have carried out.

## Evaluation Metric:
Submissions are evaluated on F1-Score between the predicted class and the observed target.

## Approach
I first cleaned the data set and made it ready for visualization. Further, I plotted various columns to check the behaviour of the dataset. After plotting the graphs, I used LabelEncoder to encode the categorical variables.Then I used Feature Scaling to rescale the dataset. Then I used Decision Tree Classifier to train the dataset. I also used Random Search CV to select best paramters of the model.

## F1 Score= 0.2698
